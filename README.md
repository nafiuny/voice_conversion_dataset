# voice_conversion_dataset

Voice Conversion is a technology that modifies the speech of a source speaker and makes their speech sound like that of another target speaker without changing the linguistic information.

We need a data set to run audio conversion models. Here is a list of the most important datasets.



This data set contains audio along with their text file.
